## Predictive Modeling for Patient Health Outcomes

## Problem Statement

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to derive insights from patient health data. Using features such as **age**, **BMI**, **asthma**, and **hypertension**, the goal is to build predictive models that estimate critical health outcomes.

## Objectives

* **Linear Regression**: Predict **BMI** based on **age**.
* **Logistic Regression**: Estimate the **likelihood of patient survival**.
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: **Classify cholesterol levels** based on input data.

## Why This Matters

Accurate predictions from health data can improve **diagnosis**, **preventive care**, and **treatment planning**. This project showcases how raw clinical features can be transformed into **actionable insights** using classical ML algorithms.
